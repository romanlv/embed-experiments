<title>Blue Birds - NFT Collection | Highlight</title><meta name="description" content="In an unparalleled feat of avian artistry, Blue Birds swoop into the world, casting their shadows over uniqueness bringing the cozy comfort of sameness. &#13;&#13;It&apos;s a known chirp that the allure of the unique often leads to a solitary flight. So, in a bold move that&apos;s ruffled more than a few feathers, Blue Birds brings 500 pieces that sing the same melodious tune. Each one of these little guys is as unique as a donut with a different sprinkle,&#13;&#13;Yes, you read that right. Each artwork in the Blue Birds series is as identical as a flock of sparrows skirting the winter sky. In the world of Blue Birds, every feather tells a story, every hue a deeper truth. To own one is to explore the vast landscapes of art and technology, where the pursuit of sameness finds its home. Each Blue Bird carries a soul of colors, a vibrant declaration of sameness amidst the crowd.&#13;&#13;Imagine, if you will, 500 pieces that, to the untrained eye, seem as identical as the eggs in a robin&apos;s cozy nest. But, as any ornithologist will tell you, no two birds are truly alike, even if at first glance they appear to be twins from the same clutch. &#13;&#13;PLEASE REMEMBER THAT ALL OF THE BLUE BIRDS ARE THE SAME&#13;&#13;" />
